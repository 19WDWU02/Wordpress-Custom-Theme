# 19WDWU02 Custom Wordpress theme

This is a demo theme built in class for the class of 19WDWU02 at Yoobee Colleges: School of Design in Wellington.  
It is a work in progress with each commit being a topic we have done in class.  

### Installation
To install the theme you will need to have a blank version of wordpress which you can get from [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/).  
Once you have gone through the wordpress set up. Clone this repository inside the  `/wp-content/themes/` directory.  
From there you will have to go onto the wordpress admin dashboard and active the theme, then you will be good to go.
